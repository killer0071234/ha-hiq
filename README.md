## Supported devices

This integration enables basic support for HIQ-Controllers (Cybro 2/3 PLC with HIQ software running on it from Robotina D.o.o or Cybrotech).

## Functionality

This integration is a local polling integration that connects to a running CybroScgiServer from Cybrotech.
To use this integration you need to have a running scgi server.
Please use one of the 3 methods to run the scgi server.
Without a running scgi server it is not possible to use this integration!

- Homeassistant Addon CybroScgiServer (Recommended)

  [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

- Own Docker container on own Docker host.

  [![dockerhub][scgi-docker-shield]][scgi-docker]

- Native manual install from source.

## Supported entities

During creation of the device it scans for supported device types and creates it in home assistant.
If the `general_error` of the HIQ expansion unit is set, the device will be ignored (Default behaviour of hiq software).
To add all possible entities there exists a option.

Currently supported are:

- [light](#light)
- [cover](#cover)
- [climate](#climate)
- [binary_sensor](#binary_sensor)
- [sensor](#sensor)
- [number](#number)
- [select](#select)
- [switch](#switch)

### Manual

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your [HA configuration](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `hiq`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/hiq/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
8. Click "Integrations"
9. Click "+ Add Integration"
10. Search for "HIQ"

{% endif %}

## Configuration (Important! Please Read)

Config is done in the HA integrations UI.

### Disable new entities

If you prefer new entities to be disabled by default:

1. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
2. Click "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the bottom right corner for the HIQ integration
4. Click "System options"
5. Disable "Enable newly added entities"

## Tested Devices
