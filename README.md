## Functionality

This integration is a local polling integration that connects to a running CybroScgiServer from Cybrotech.
To use this integration you need to have a running scgi server.
Please use one of the 3 methods to run the scgi server.
Without a running scgi server it is not possible to use this integration!

- Homeassistant Addon CybroScgiServer (Recommended)

  [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

- Own Docker container on own Docker host.

  [![dockerhub][scgi-docker-shield]][scgi-docker]

- Native manual install from source.

## Supported entities

During creation of the device it scans for supported device types and creates it in home assistant.
If the `general_error` of the HIQ expansion unit is set, the device will be ignored (Default behaviour of hiq software).
To add all possible entities there exists a option.

Currently supported are:

- [light](#light)
- [cover](#cover)
- [binary_sensor](#binary_sensor)
- [sensor](#sensor)

---

### light<a name="light"></a>

Supported HIQ expansion units:

- LC-10-IQ (light on / off supported)
- LC-8-IQ (light on / off supported)
- LD-D10-IQ (light on / off, brightness and RGB supported)
- LD-D8-IQ (light on / off and brightness supported)
- LD-P4-IQ (light on / off, brightness and RGB supported)
- LD-V4-IQ (light on / off, brightness and RGB supported)
- Virtual LC (light on / off supported)

---

### cover<a name="cover"></a>

Blinds in the HIQ controller are called [cover](#cover) devices in HA.

Supported HIQ expansion units:

- BC-5-IQ
- Virtual BC

Possible commands for the blinds are:

- open cover
- close cover
- stop cover
- set position

---

### binary_sensor<a name="binary_sensor"></a>

To have a basic diagnostic, there are some `binary_sensor` Entities exposed.

#### For the controller:
