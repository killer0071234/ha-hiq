## Functionality

This integration is a local polling integration that connects to a running cybro-scgi-server from Cybrotech.
To use this integration you need to have a running scgi server (it could be a docker container or native installed).
Further informations of the docker container can be found here: [![dockerhub][scgi-docker-shield]][scgi-docker]

## Supported entities

During creation of the device it scans for supported device types and creates it in home assistant.
If the `general_error` of the HIQ expansion unit is set, the device will be ignored.
To add all possible entities there exists a option.

Currently supported are:

- [light](#light)
- [cover](#cover)
- [binary_sensor](#binary_sensor)
- [sensor](#sensor)

---

### light<a name="light"></a>

Supported HIQ expansion units:

- LC-10-IQ (light on / off supported)

---

### cover<a name="cover"></a>

Supported HIQ expansion units:

- BC-5-IQ

Possible commands for the blinds are:

- open cover
- close cover
- stop cover
- set position

---

### binary_sensor<a name="binary_sensor"></a>

To have a basic diagnostic, there are some `binary_sensor` Entities exposed.

#### For the controller:

| Entity name            | Description                                                                        | Enabled |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `cXXXX.general_error`  | Logical or of IEX general errors, indicates that at least one module has an error. | yes     |
| `cXXXX.retentive_fail` | Indicates that retentive memory failed.                                            | yes     |
| `cXXXX.scan_overrun`   | Too long scan execution caused scan overrun error.                                 | yes     |

#### For every IEX expansion unit:

| Entity name                | Description                                                                  | Enabled |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `cXXXX.YYYY_general_error` | Combined system error (timeout or program error), module is not operational. | yes     |

XXXX is the NAD of the controller, and YYYY is the IEX module prefix

---

### sensor<a name="sensor"></a>

To have a basic diagnostic, there are some `sensor` Entities exposed.

#### For the controller:

| Entity name                | Description                                                         | Enabled |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `cXXXX.scan_time`          | Last scan execution time [ms].                                      | no      |
| `cXXXX.scan_time_max`      | Maximal scan execution time encountered since program started [ms]. | no      |
| `cXXXX.scan_frequency`     | Actual number of scans per second.                                  | no      |
| `cXXXX.cybro_power_supply` | Measured power supply voltage [V]. Measuring range is 0..40V.       | no      |
| `cXXXX.cybro_uptime`       | Number of operating hours since power-on [h].                       | no      |
| `cXXXX.operating_hours`    | Total number of operating hours [h].                                | no      |
| `cXXXX.sys.ip_port`        | IP address and UDP port of the controller.                          | yes     |

#### For every IEX expansion unit:

| Entity name                   | Description                                                   | Enabled |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `cXXXX.YYYY_iex_power_supply` | Measured power supply voltage [V]. Measuring range is 0..40V. | no      |

#### power meter:

In presence of a power meter, it will add the following Entities:

| Entity name                 | Description                     | Enabled |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| `cXXXX.power_meter_power`   | Measured power consumption [W]. | yes     |
| `cXXXX.power_meter_energy`  | Energy consumption total [kWh]. | yes     |
| `cXXXX.power_meter_voltage` | Measured AC voltage [V].        | no      |

#### temperatures:

In presence of expansion units with temperature / humidity sensors, it will add the following Entities:

| Entity name              | Description                             | Enabled                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

| `cXXXX.YYYY_humidity`    | Measured relative humidity (0..100%rh). | if module has no `general_error` |

XXXX is the NAD of the controller, and YYYY is the IEX module prefix (eg: lc00, bc02..)

{% if not installed %}

## Installation

### HACS

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
2. Go to HACS "Integrations >" section
3. In the lower right click "+ Explore & Download repositories"
4. Search for "HIQ" and add it
   - HA Restart is not needed since it is configured in UI config flow
5. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
6. Click "Integrations"
7. Click "+ Add Integration"
8. Search for "HIQ"

### Manual

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your [HA configuration](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `hiq`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/hiq/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
8. Click "Integrations"
9. Click "+ Add Integration"
10. Search for "HIQ"

{% endif %}

## Configuration (Important! Please Read)

Config is done in the HA integrations UI.

### Disable new entities

If you prefer new entities to be disabled by default:

1. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
2. Click "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the bottom right corner for the HIQ integration
4. Click "System options"
5. Disable "Enable newly added entities"

## Tested Devices

- HC-HIQ v3.0.3 Software running on a Cybro-3 controller with FW: 3.2.0, cybroscgiserver v3.1.3 running in a docker container
